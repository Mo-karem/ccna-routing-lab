# CCNA Network Design Project

This project is a hands-on simulation created using **Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of my CCNA learning path. It represents a medium-sized enterprise network with proper segmentation and configuration.

## 🔧 Features:
- Subnetting for multiple departments (Sales, Marketing, HR)
- VLAN creation and inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick
- Static and Dynamic Routing (RIP & OSPF)
- DHCP configuration
- NAT and ACL implementation
- Device restrictions and time policies
- Custom user controls and access management
- Logical network topology with clear IP addressing plan

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking concepts from CCNA curriculum

## 📁 Files:
- `.pkt` file (main project)
- Project image/screenshot (topology)
